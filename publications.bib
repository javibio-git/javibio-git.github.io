  abstract  = "Almost all animals possess gut microbial communities, but the
               nature of these communities varies immensely. For example, in
               social bees and mammals, the composition is relatively constant
               within species and is dominated by specialist bacteria that do
               not live elsewhere; in laboratory studies and field surveys of
               Drosophila melanogaster, however, gut communities consist of
               bacteria that are ingested with food and that vary widely among
               individuals and localities. We addressed whether an ecological
               specialist in its natural habitat has a microbiota dominated by
               gut specialists or by environmental bacteria. Drosophila
               nigrospiracula is a species that is endemic to the Sonoran Desert
               and is restricted to decaying tissues of two giant columnar
               cacti, Pachycereus pringlei (cardón cactus) and Carnegiea
               gigantea (saguaro cactus). We found that the D. nigrospiracula
               microbiota differs strikingly from that of the cactus tissue on
               which the flies feed. The most abundant bacteria in the flies are
               rare or completely absent in the cactus tissue and are
               consistently abundant in flies from different cacti and
               localities. Several of these fly-associated bacterial groups,
               such as the bacterial order Orbales and the genera Serpens and
               Dysgonomonas, have been identified in prior surveys of insects
               from the orders Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and
               Diptera, including several Drosophila species. Although the
               functions of these bacterial groups are mostly unexplored,
               Orbales species studied in bees are known to break down plant
               polysaccharides and use the resulting sugars. Thus, these
               bacterial groups appear to be specialized to the insect gut
               environment, where they may colonize through direct host-to-host
               transmission in natural settings.IMPORTANCE Flies in the genus
               Drosophila have become laboratory models for microbiota research,
               yet the bacteria commonly used in these experiments are rarely
               found in wild-caught flies and instead represent bacteria also
               present in the food. This study shows that an ecologically
               specialized Drosophila species possesses a distinctive
               microbiome, composed of bacterial types absent from the flies'
               natural food but widespread in other wild-caught insects. This
               study highlights the importance of fieldwork-informed microbiota
               research.",

  abstract  = "Structural genomic variants are key drivers of phenotypic
               evolution. They can span hundreds to millions of base pairs and
               can thus affect large numbers of genetic elements. Although
               structural variation is quite common within and between species,
               its characterization depends upon the quality of genome
               assemblies and the proportion of repetitive elements. Using new
               high-quality genome assemblies, we report a complex and
               previously hidden landscape of structural divergence between the
               genomes of Drosophila persimilis and D. pseudoobscura, two
               classic species in speciation research, and study the
               relationships among structural variants, transposable elements,
               and gene expression divergence. The new assemblies confirm the
               already known fixed inversion differences between these species.
               Consistent with previous studies showing higher levels of
               nucleotide divergence between fixed inversions relative to
               collinear regions of the genome, we also find a significant
               overrepresentation of INDELs inside the inversions. We find that
               transposable elements accumulate in regions with low levels of
               recombination, and spatial correlation analyses reveal a strong
               association between transposable elements and structural
               variants. We also report a strong association between
               differentially expressed (DE) genes and structural variants and
               an overrepresentation of DE genes inside the fixed chromosomal
               inversions that separate this species pair. Interestingly,
               species-specific structural variants are overrepresented in DE
               genes involved in neural development, spermatogenesis, and
               oocyte-to-embryo transition. Overall, our results highlight the
               association of transposable elements with structural variants and
               their importance in driving evolutionary divergence.",

               explore the influence of ecological adaptation on transcriptomic
               responses to isocaloric diets differing in their relative
               proportions of protein to sugar. Drosophila melanogaster, a
               cosmopolitan species that breeds in decaying fruit, exemplifies
               individuals long exposed to a Western diet higher in sugar, while
               the natural diet of the cactophilic D. mojavensis, is much lower
               in carbohydrates. Drosophila arizonae, the sister species of D.
               mojavensis, is largely cactophilic, but also utilizes rotting
               fruits that are higher in sugars than cacti. We exposed third
               instar larvae for 24 hours to diets either (1) high in protein
               relative to sugar, (2) diets with equal amounts of protein and
               sugar, and (3) diets low in protein but high in sugar. As we
               predicted, based upon earlier interspecific studies of
               development and metabolism, the most extreme differences in gene
               expression under different dietary conditions were found in D.
               mojavensis followed by D. arizonae. No differential expression
               among diets was observed for D. melanogaster, a species that
               survives well under all three conditions, with little impact on
               its metabolism. We suggest that these three species together
               provide a model to examine individual and population differences
               in vulnerability to lifestyle-associated health problems such as
               metabolic syndrome and diabetes.",
