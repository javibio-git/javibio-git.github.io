 abstract = {We utilized three ecologically diverse Drosophila species to
explore the influence of ecological adaptation on transcriptomic
responses to isocaloric diets differing in their relative
proportions of protein to sugar. Drosophila melanogaster, a
cosmopolitan species that breeds in decaying fruit, exemplifies
individuals long exposed to a Western diet higher in sugar, while
the natural diet of the cactophilic D. mojavensis, is much lower
in carbohydrates. Drosophila arizonae, the sister species of D.
mojavensis, is largely cactophilic, but also utilizes rotting
fruits that are higher in sugars than cacti. We exposed third
instar larvae for 24 hours to diets either (1) high in protein
relative to sugar, (2) diets with equal amounts of protein and
sugar, and (3) diets low in protein but high in sugar. As we
predicted, based upon earlier interspecific studies of
development and metabolism, the most extreme differences in gene
expression under different dietary conditions were found in D.
mojavensis followed by D. arizonae. No differential expression
among diets was observed for D. melanogaster, a species that
survives well under all three conditions, with little impact on
its metabolism. We suggest that these three species together
provide a model to examine individual and population differences
in vulnerability to lifestyle-associated health problems such as
metabolic syndrome and diabetes.},
