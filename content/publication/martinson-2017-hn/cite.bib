 abstract = {Almost all animals possess gut microbial communities, but the
nature of these communities varies immensely. For example, in
social bees and mammals, the composition is relatively constant
within species and is dominated by specialist bacteria that do
not live elsewhere; in laboratory studies and field surveys of
Drosophila melanogaster, however, gut communities consist of
bacteria that are ingested with food and that vary widely among
individuals and localities. We addressed whether an ecological
specialist in its natural habitat has a microbiota dominated by
gut specialists or by environmental bacteria. Drosophila
nigrospiracula is a species that is endemic to the Sonoran Desert
and is restricted to decaying tissues of two giant columnar
cacti, Pachycereus pringlei (card√≥n cactus) and Carnegiea
gigantea (saguaro cactus). We found that the D. nigrospiracula
microbiota differs strikingly from that of the cactus tissue on
which the flies feed. The most abundant bacteria in the flies are
rare or completely absent in the cactus tissue and are
consistently abundant in flies from different cacti and
localities. Several of these fly-associated bacterial groups,
such as the bacterial order Orbales and the genera Serpens and
Dysgonomonas, have been identified in prior surveys of insects
from the orders Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and
Diptera, including several Drosophila species. Although the
functions of these bacterial groups are mostly unexplored,
Orbales species studied in bees are known to break down plant
polysaccharides and use the resulting sugars. Thus, these
bacterial groups appear to be specialized to the insect gut
environment, where they may colonize through direct host-to-host
transmission in natural settings.IMPORTANCE Flies in the genus
Drosophila have become laboratory models for microbiota research,
yet the bacteria commonly used in these experiments are rarely
found in wild-caught flies and instead represent bacteria also
present in the food. This study shows that an ecologically
specialized Drosophila species possesses a distinctive
microbiome, composed of bacterial types absent from the flies'
natural food but widespread in other wild-caught insects. This
study highlights the importance of fieldwork-informed microbiota
research.},
