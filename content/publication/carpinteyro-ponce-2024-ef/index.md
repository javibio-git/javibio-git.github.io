abstract: Structural genomic variants are key drivers of phenotypic evolution. They
  can span hundreds to millions of base pairs and can thus affect large numbers of
  genetic elements. Although structural variation is quite common within and between
  species, its characterization depends upon the quality of genome assemblies and
  the proportion of repetitive elements. Using new high-quality genome assemblies,
  we report a complex and previously hidden landscape of structural divergence between
  the genomes of Drosophila persimilis and D. pseudoobscura, two classic species in
  speciation research, and study the relationships among structural variants, transposable
  elements, and gene expression divergence. The new assemblies confirm the already
  known fixed inversion differences between these species. Consistent with previous
  studies showing higher levels of nucleotide divergence between fixed inversions
  relative to collinear regions of the genome, we also find a significant overrepresentation
  of INDELs inside the inversions. We find that transposable elements accumulate in
  regions with low levels of recombination, and spatial correlation analyses reveal
  a strong association between transposable elements and structural variants. We also
  report a strong association between differentially expressed (DE) genes and structural
  variants and an overrepresentation of DE genes inside the fixed chromosomal inversions
  that separate this species pair. Interestingly, species-specific structural variants
  are overrepresented in DE genes involved in neural development, spermatogenesis,
  and oocyte-to-embryo transition. Overall, our results highlight the association
  of transposable elements with structural variants and their importance in driving
  evolutionary divergence.
